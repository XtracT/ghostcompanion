## About this fork

This is a fork of [**OliRafa/ghostcompanion**](https://github.com/OliRafa/ghostcompanion),
created and authored by **Rafael Oliveira** ([@OliRafa](https://github.com/OliRafa)).
All credit for the original design, architecture, and feature set belongs to him.

The original project ships as a one-shot container: it runs once, exports
the data, and exits, relying on an external scheduler (e.g.
[Ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia)) to trigger periodic runs.
This fork keeps that as the default behaviour and adds an **optional
built-in cron scheduler** so the same image can also run as a continuous
service, controlled by the [`CRON_SCHEDULE`](#environment-variables)
environment variable. No external scheduler is needed in that mode.

The default `docker-compose.yml` is unchanged from upstream (one-shot +
external scheduler). To use the built-in scheduler instead, run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.cron.yml up -d`; see
[Docker Compose](#docker-compose).

All changes made in this fork are confined to the Docker runtime
(`Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `docker-compose.cron.yml`, and this README).
The application code is unchanged from upstream. If the upstream project
ever adopts a built-in scheduler, this fork will likely be retired in
favour of it.

## Getting Started

GhostCompanion plugin works best when doing account management all by itself.
In other words, manually creating activities in your Ghostfolio account
is not only not needed, but it's also discouraged.
That's because some operations (like symbol change, or stock splits)
need to understand the complete picture of the account, and change its state
totally (see [Interactive Brokers Flex Queries and Caveats](#interactive-brokers-flex-queries-and-caveats)
for the only exception).

It'll start by getting (or creating) accounts for each source
(`Coinbase`, `Interactive Brokers` or `Tastytrade`) from Ghostfolio,
and from that it'll start adding trading transactions and/or dividends.

This plugin runs completely in the background, and is provided as
container images hosted on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/olirafa/ghostcompanion) for `linux/amd64`.

### Environment Variables

Start by setting up the appropriate environment variables, listed below.

| Name                       | Type                | Default Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COINBASE_API_KEY_ID`      | `string`            |                       | The _Coinbase_ API Key.                                                                                                                                         |
| `COINBASE_SECRET`          | `string`            |                       | The _Coinbase_ Secret.

| `GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` | `string`            |                       | The _Ghostfolio_ Account Token.                                                                                                                                         |
| `GHOSTFOLIO_BASE_URL`      | `string` (optional) | "<https://ghostfol.io>" | The _Ghostfolio_ URL. If you're self hosting you should change it for your particular instance URL, otherwise all data will be exported to _Ghostfolio_ cloud offering. |
| `IBKR_QUERY`               | `string`            |                       | The _Interactive Brokers_ Flex Query ID.                                                                                                                                              |

| `CRON_SCHEDULE`            | `string` (optional) |                       | When set, switches the container into service mode: it runs continuously and executes GhostCompanion on the given cron schedule (e.g. `0 8 * * *`, `@weekly`). Leave unset for one-shot mode. Only used with `docker-compose.cron.yml`. |

For how to generate the TastyTrade variables, please refer to [this documentation](https://tastyworks-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sessions.html).
For how to generate the Interactive Brokers variables, please refer to
[Interactive Brokers Flex Queries and Caveats](#interactive-brokers-flex-queries-and-caveats).

If you don't wish to use all available providers when importing transactions,
simply don't provide the environment variables related to it.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Docker

For evaluation, you can run it by:

```sh
docker run --rm --name ghostcompanion \
-e GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<account_token> \
-e TASTYTRADE_CLIENT_SECRET=my_client_secret \
-e TASTYTRADE_REFRESH_TOKEN=super_secure_token \
olirafa/ghostcompanion
```

It'll spawn the container, ingest all data from Tastytrade,
export it all to Ghostfolio, and then remove the container at the end.

To unleash the plugin's potential, you would want to deploy it scheduled
to run from time to time (weekly, for example).
For that, two approaches are presented, deploying using
[Docker Compose](#docker-compose) or in your
[Kubernetes](#kubernetes) cluster.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Docker Compose

Two presets are provided:

- **`docker-compose.yml`** (default, unchanged from upstream): one-shot
  mode. The container runs GhostCompanion once and exits, scheduled by
  the bundled [Ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia) sidecar
  (`@weekly` by default).
- **`docker-compose.cron.yml`** (this fork): service mode. The container
  runs continuously and executes GhostCompanion on the
  [`CRON_SCHEDULE`](#environment-variables) environment variable, set to
  daily at 8am by default. No external scheduler is needed.

> ⚠️ Only set `CRON_SCHEDULE` when using `docker-compose.cron.yml`.
> Setting it in `.env` while running the default compose file would put
> the one-shot container into service mode and the Ofelia sidecar would
> no longer be the trigger.

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OliRafa/ghostcompanion.git
```

Enter the repo folder:

```sh
cd ghostcompanion
```

Then, you'll need a `.env` file with the
[environment variables](#environment-variables) set.
A example file can be found [here](https://github.com/OliRafa/ghostcompanion/blob/main/.env.example).

With everything ready, run one of:

```sh
# Default: one-shot mode scheduled by Ofelia (weekly)
docker compose up -d

# Fork: service mode with the built-in cron scheduler
docker compose -f docker-compose.cron.yml up -d
```

The default deploy runs GhostCompanion once a week via Ofelia. The cron
preset runs it continuously on the `CRON_SCHEDULE` (daily at 8am by
default; override in `.env`).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Kubernetes

Start by deploying [environment variables](#environment-variables) as
[ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap) and/or
[Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret).

Since Kubernetes has a build-in scheduler, you can create a CronJob following
[the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs).

For an example of such CronJob deployment, take a look below:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: ghostcompanion
  namespace: ghostfolio
spec:
  schedule: "@hourly"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: ghostcompanion
              image: olirafa/ghostcompanion
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              env:
                - name: GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: ghostcompanion-configs
                      key: GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
                - name: GHOSTFOLIO_BASE_URL
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: ghostcompanion-configs
                      key: GHOSTFOLIO_BASE_URL
                - name: TASTYTRADE_CLIENT_SECRET
                  valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                      name: tastytrade-credentials
                      key: client_secret
                - name: TASTYTRADE_REFRESH_TOKEN 
                  valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                      name: tastytrade-credentials
                      key: refresh_token
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Interactive Brokers Flex Queries and Caveats

Current implementation for getting Interactive Brokers transactions
relies on Flex Queries.

To generate the Flex Query, please refer to
[the official documentation](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/performanceandstatements/flex.htm).

At minimum, you'll need the following configurations:

* Select `Change in Dividend Accruals`
  * Mark all checkboxes
* Select `Trades`
  * Select `Execution`
  * Mark all checkboxes
* Select Format `XML`
* Select Date Format `yyyyMMdd`
* Select Time Format `HHmmss`
* Select Date/Time Separator `; (semi-colon)`
* Select `Include Canceled Trades`

On `Period` comes the caveat.
Flex Queries only allows for a maximum period of `Last 365 Calendar Days`,
which means that any transaction prior to that date won't be listed in the
Flex Query, and hence it won't be automatically inserted into Ghostfolio.

This means that any transaction prior to that date should be added manually
in Ghostfolio, and GhostCompanion won't change those when updating the account
with new transactions.

### Continuous Integration

CI is a single script, `scripts/ci.sh`, that runs formatting (Black), import
sorting (isort), linting (pylama), and the test suite. The exact same script
runs as the `pre-commit` and `pre-push` git hooks and on GitHub Actions, so
whatever passes locally passes CI. Run `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` once after
cloning to enable the hooks; run `./scripts/ci.sh` any time to reproduce CI.
